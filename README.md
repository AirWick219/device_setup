Device Setup

## Device Setup

To quickly setup your device, you can run the following setup script using this command from your Terminal:

```
curl -o- https://raw.github.com/AirWick219/main/device_setup.sh | sh
```

**NOTE:** The script will install XCode CLI tools and will pause while the XCode CLI install happens. Wait for the CLI install to finish before continuing the setup script.
